name: Watermancer unified plan model
description: Shared orchestration contract for Watermancer water-fill and salt-match actions
---

Watermancer actions should be represented by one plan containing target ions, selected waters and salts, fixed volumes/doses, strategy, ion priority, and explicit overshoot policy. The existing chemistry helpers remain the calculation source of truth.

**Why:** Separate autofill and autocraft state made it difficult to know whether a displayed match still represented the user's complete set of decisions.

**How to apply:** Derive the current plan from the Watermancer UI state, use its deterministic signature to invalidate stale matches, and route orchestration through existing water-fill and salt-dose helpers rather than adding a second solver.
